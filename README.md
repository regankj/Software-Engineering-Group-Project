# Software-Engineering-Group-Project
Quiz created for university group project

The quiz is targeted for school children aged around 11-13. I was responsible for the database of questions, and the UI which enabled users to add/edit/delete 
questions. Specifically, the "enter_mc.py" and "enter_tf,py" files. Run Quizardry.py to run the quiz.
